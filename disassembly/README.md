# Disassembly
thanks to Tronic Effect



### If you want to reduce the size of the code file:

It is possible to assemble the data files to a file in devpac for each decompiled data set and then use an incbin for this file replacing the disassembled data set data  
    
 If that makes sense!!

 This will make the code smaller without data files decompiled and added to the code by the disassembler

 Cut and paste the decompiled data files out of the code, compile as data in devpac, replace decompiled data in the code with incbin of compiled data file extract

### how to disassemble
Run easyrider in hatari emulator

Load the prg

You will need to convert several parts from data to code, and others from code to data

save the source as re-assemble version
