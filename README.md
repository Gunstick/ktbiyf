Kicking The Bass In Your Face

A demo for atari ST (and ste) https://demozoo.org/productions/136767/

One of the first 8 voice player on the ST created 1991, never finished 1992
Features cool triangle VU meter display in overscan.

The 8voice_a and 8voice_b folders are the original floppies
which were also used to show off the demo as pre release
But nothing more happened after that.

Aim of the project:
* reverse engineer (disassemble) the binaries
* document the sound format
* create a complete demo with file selector

Bonus
* adapt code to octalyser format to be able to play other tunes
* convert original tracks to octalyser for distribution

What is special about this demo?
* 8 voices on normal ST (seems to have special STE mode)
* overscan
* never before seen VU meter display with variable slope triangles
* instruments 1:2 compressed with the domino 4bit sound packer
